Sycl Accelerated evaluation of potential kernels

The project is in its planning stage. Goals are

- Fast direct evaluation of frequently used potential kernels
- SIMD acceleration on CPUs
- GPU offloading via Sycl
- Python interface with Pybind11/CFFI

An aim of this project is to demonstrate modern heterogeneous compute technologies based on Sycl and OneAPI.
